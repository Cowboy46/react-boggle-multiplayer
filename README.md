# react-boggle-multiplayer

## Description

An online, multiplayer Boggle game created in React

## Setup

Clone this repository and run the following commands in the terminal:

    cd react-boggle-multiplayer/api
    npm install
    npm start

Open a new terminal tab and run the following commands:

    cd react-boggle-multiplayer/client
    npm install
    npm start

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and the application will be running!

## Code

The client application code here was taken initially from my previous project, [react-boggle](https://github.com/Cowboy46/react-boggle), which is a single player version of the game.

I followed the steps on [this blog post](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/socket-react/#socketio-react-and-nodejs-hands-on) for getting started with Express and Socket.io.
