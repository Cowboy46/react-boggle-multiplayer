# Multi-Player Boggle Web App

## Description

A multiplayer Boggle game created in React. The game is not permanently hosted online yet. However, follow the sections below to setup and run the app locally.

## Local Setup

Clone this repository and run the following commands:

    cd react-boggle-multiplayer
    npm install
    cd client
    npm install

To run the app, first run the following command to begin the backend server:

    cd react-boggle-multiplayer
    npm start

Then, in a separate terminal window, run the following commands to begin the client server:

    cd client
    npm start

You should see a browser window automatically open and the Boggle web app displayed on `http://localhost:8080`. Enjoy!

## Code

The client application code was taken initially from my previous project, [react-boggle](https://github.com/Cowboy46/react-boggle), which is a completely single-player version of the game.

I followed the steps on [this blog post](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/socket-react/#socketio-react-and-nodejs-hands-on) for getting started with Express and Socket.io.
